List Of Bots Available and History:

# Woo3:

    Branch-Name: "seek-Closest-Fishes-wood-solution"
    Description: Attempts to scan the closest fishes for the drones.

# Bronze/Silver:

    Branch-Name: "gold-stratigie-v0-startWithLegenType"
        Description: Drones move down and up while rotating the velocity vector if a collision is detected
        with uglys or edges of the map.
        
    Branch-Name: "gold-stratigie-v1-cleanScan"
        Description: Drones start by targeting fishes at the bottom (type:2), then scan the fishes above 
        to the top and save them. It also handles collision avoidance. Once all fishes are scanned, the 
        drones kick out the remaining fishes that opponents have not scanned yet.

# Gold:
    Branch-Name: "master"
        Description: Drones focus on reaching a distant location, where they then systematically search for any remaining
        unscanned fish. Additionally, the drones assess the potential to displace some fish within the mapped area.
